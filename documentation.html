        <h3>Process/Work Division</h3>
        <p>We started with an API prototype, made by Corey. From there up until the critique, Corey worked on CSS/HTML and Rhys worked on CSS. 
            After the critique, we swapped those roles, and also did some of both towards the end.
            Overall grade we think we deserve is an A, as we put a lot of work into making this a clean interface.
